# Spreedly Airlines - Brittany

To get started, add credentials (Spreedly environment key, Spreedly access secret, and test gateway and PMD gateway tokens associated with that environment) to an env.rb file. Once credentials have been added, you can run the app by starting a rails server (`rails s`) and navigating to localhost:3000.

Notes during process:
* I found it a little confusing at first to figure out exactly how environment keys and access secrets were associated (do you have to connect an access key to a given environment, can you use any access key that's been created with any environment key, etc). Id does make clear that you can use any access secret with any environment, but I'm under the impression that best practices would have you create a new access secret for each environment, as mentioned in the getting started guide. There could potentially be some clarification of best practices in the access secret section of Id.
* Overall the getting started section of the documentation was helpful and straightforward - the sample requests helped me understand how to get things initially set up. While it does include a link about the different approaches to collecting payment data, that link felt a little bit buried on the page (https://docs.spreedly.com/basics/payment-method/). Maybe the chart [here](https://docs.spreedly.com/guides/adding-payment-methods/) or some modified version of it could be included directly in this section, or a blurb added that does a brief outline of the different approaches, and then links to more info.
* I thought the Spreedly gem was useful as I started working through the exercise, so it may be good to link to that (and any other supporting libraries) in the guides somewhere. _However, on closer look at that repo, it seems like our goal is not to support it, so in that case not including it does make sense...but maybe we should make a note in the gem README discouraging it's use if that's the case so others who stumble on it recognize that it's not a preferred method._
* The sample apps and forms were really useful in implementing the form, but some of the apps seemed like they maybe hadn't been touched in a while. Not sure if anything in them is specifically outdated or no longer recommended, but if we don't already, it may be useful to assess them as compliance guidelines or other changes take place to make sure they still follow best practices.
* PMD was definitely the thing I struggled most to wrap my head around. This might just be due to my general unfamiliarity, but it wasn't immediately clear exactly why/how a client would implement a PMD solution - e.g. after delivering the template, what exactly should happen and how do we know it's successful? Generally, modeling the idea of completing an actual payment via PMD was confusing for me, but I think some of it was just the fact that this was a testing flow against an echo endpoint rather than the real thing (and the real thing wasn't quite clicking). Maybe linking to or outlining some real-life use cases would be helpful, if possible. For instance, [this article](https://www.spreedly.com/blog/building-a-clover-application-with-spreedly) helped me understand.
* In general, there were a few typos here and there, and link anchors that were no longer present - I can try to update those in the repo.
